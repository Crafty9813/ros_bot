## Robot Package Template

This is a GitHub template from Articulated Robotics.

This is a project for a mobile robot using any RPLiDAR. I'm not using any vision, I just want to use SLAM as of now using slam_toolbox. I'm kind of stuck, as I don't really know how to actually incorporate slam_toolbox and I also don't have a physical robot yet as I took my LiDAR for a basic Arduino project. I'm planning on putting this project on hold for now, maybe first actually build a physical chassis and order some encoder motors.
